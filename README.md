# Project: Spring Social Media Blog API

## Overview 

This project is a backend for a hypothetical social media app, where we must manage our usersâ€™ accounts as well as any messages that they submit to the application. The functionality for this project leverages a popular web application framework for Java known as Spring. The Spring framework allows for automatic injection and configuration of many features, including data persitence, endpoints and conventional data manipulation logic (CRUD operations).

In our hypothetical micro-blogging or messaging app, any user will be able to see all of the messages posted to the site, or they can see the messages posted by a particular user. The backend, created here, is able to deliver the data needed to display this information as well as process actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions.
